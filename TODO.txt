Some todos:

- split out functions from the too-large cmd class into separate files;
- manage csv and show display with pandas dataframes
- investigate using stevedore for managing plugins
- porting to python3
    - see what aspects of http://compiletoi.net/fast-scraping-in-python-with-asyncio.html to take on;
- gui interface - steal from: https://github.com/scrapinghub/portia
